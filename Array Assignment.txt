Q1 - What do mean by an array ?

ANS - An array in Java is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same data type under a single variable name. An array can hold a fixed number of elements, and each element is accessed by its index.
Example - 
int[] myArray = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};


Q2 - How to create an array ?

ANS -  To create an array in Java, you need to declare the array variable and then initialize it with the desired number of elements. 
Syntax - 
// Syntax to declare and initialize an array
dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[arraySize];

// Example of creating an array of integers with 5 elements
int[] myArray = new int[5]; 

Q3 - Can we change the size of the array at the runtime ?

ANS -  The size of an array is fixed once it is created, and you cannot change it directly. Once you create an array with a specific size, you cannot resize it.  


Q4 - Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array ?

ANS -  you cannot directly change the size of an array after it has been created. However, you can achieve similar functionality using collections such as ArrayList, which allows dynamic resizing.


Q5 - What is the defaut value of arrays ?

ANS - In Java, when you declare an array, each element of the array is automatically initialized to a default value based on its data type. The default values for arrays are as follows:

Numeric Types (byte, short, int, long, float, double): 0
char:  (null character)
boolean: false
Reference Types (objects): null .

Q6 -  What is a 1D array with  example ? 

ANs -  A 1D array, also known as a one-dimensional array, is a linear collection of elements of the same data type. Each element in the array is accessed by a single index.
Example - File attached below.   
(array.java)


Q9 - Write a program of  a 2D array  ?

ANs - File attached below
(array(1).java)
